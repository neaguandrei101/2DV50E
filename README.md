- [x] You title should be:
A Systematic Literature Review on the Methodologies for Detecting REST Antipatterns in RESTful APIs

- [ ] Abstract fix: This is not really the results. Rather you should give some insights of your findings from this SLR.

- [x] template fix, strict adherence is essential

- [x] Add target audience, Target audiece also practitioners, more than 1 group.

- [x] Put a link to the google sheet.

- [x] ADD colums for years for tables.

- [x] Related work: Your related work section is too short!
It has only 1 related work that is [7]. Discuss this in more detail.
Also, if there are closely related work like an SLR on the antipatterns in SOAP Web services or WSDL, you should also mention and discuss them. Then, you need to explicitly tell and discuss the gap in the literature to motivate your study.

- [x] Fix reference Alshraiedeh et al. to and katuk

- [x] Fix yr for Palma

- [x] Future work, how it is now. More opportunites for work.

- [ ]  Discuss in the discussion section about changes over the years. Also after fixing RQ3, steps detailing, discuss changes here too.

- [x] Fix all tables, experiment with other tools, possibly do it manually

- [x] RQ1 in the put in the section title approach name

- [ ] RQ2 Also, another classification can be done, for example, to what extent the studies are manual or automatic. If there are multiple steps in the methods, which steps are manual and which are automatic or semi-automatic, and so on. You can take help from Table 7.8 and identify manual or automatic steps, and then classify the studies into manual vs. automatic vs. semi-automatic... Modify data syntesis table after changes

- [ ] RQ2 use the images/code to give examples for each classification.

- [ ] RQ3 add substeps and then compare them, otherwise ok.

- [ ] RQ5 group antippaterns by type and list them, I will do for example and not list all of them.
- [ ] Final reading and checking of layout
