Abstract:
This research paper presents the results of a field survey for the characterisation of Software Maintenance Process in Portugal. It was concluded that the three biggest problems related to the Software Maintenance Process are: the lack of software maintenance process models, the lack of documentation of applications and the lack of time to satisfy the requests. Only 2.7% of the people who answered the questionnaire consider the software maintenance process very efficient; 70.2% consider it of a very low level of efficiency.
